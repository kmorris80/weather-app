Vue Weather App

Description

This weather app pulls from the Open Weather API.  It will tell you the weather from anywhere in the world.  If a country is not specified, the United States is it's default location.  When the weather is 60° or below, it will display a beautiful mountain scene. When the weather is above 60° a beach scene is shown.  Learn the temperature, humidity, conditions and the "feels like" temperature.

I used Vue to enhance my skills with this platform.  Some of the challenges that I faced was pulling from the API itself.  I also could not get the app to show the weather symbol correctly.  In the future, I want to implement the weather symbol and animations for snow, rain, etc.
